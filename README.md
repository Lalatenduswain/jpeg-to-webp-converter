# JPEG to WebP Converter Script

This Bash script converts JPEG images to WebP format using the `cwebp` tool. It's designed to be used in a Unix-like environment.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lalatenduswain/jpeg-to-webp-converter.git
    cd jpeg-to-webp-converter
    ```

2. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x webp_converter.sh
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./webp_converter.sh
    ```

The script will check for the presence of the `cwebp` tool, install it if necessary, and then convert all JPEG images in the 'lala' folder to WebP format.
